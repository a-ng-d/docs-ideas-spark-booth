# Analyse a session

Go to an activity `Settings`, then scroll down to see the `Session history`. You can retrieve all the sessions that have been run, sorted from the most recent to the oldest ones.

Click a session.

In a session, every idea created by the participants is sorted by default from the most recent to the oldest. The ideas are structured as a table with the type, the text, and the participant.

You can modify the way the ideas are displayed by:

* Changing the sorting:
  * `Most recent`.
  * `Oldest`.
* Filtering by:
  * `Types`.
  * `Participants`.

Also, you can add the session ideas to the document the same way you did after ending a session:

* On a `FigJam` board, click `Add to board`.
* On a `Slides` document, click `Add to slides`.

Finally, you can:

* Export the session:
  * As a `CSV`, the ideas can be imported into a different tool like `Microsoft Excel` or `Google Sheets`.
  * As a `JSON`, import it to another `FigJam`/`Slides` document.
* Delete a session (the action is irreversible)
