# Export the session

Go to an activity `Settings`, then scroll down to see the `Session history`.  Click a session.

You can export the session by clicking the `Ellipses` button:

* As a `CSV`, the ideas can be imported into a different tool like `Microsoft Excel` or `Google Sheets`.
* As a `JSON`, import it to another `FigJam`/`Slides` document.
