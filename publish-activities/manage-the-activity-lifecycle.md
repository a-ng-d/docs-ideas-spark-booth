# Manage the activity lifecycle

{% hint style="info" %}
An account is required to publish activities.
{% endhint %}

With our tool, you can publish any activity remotely for reuse across multiple documents. This feature enhances sharing, allowing you to inspire others. The concept is similar to Figma components: the remote activity serves as the source of truth, or `Master`, while the activity across the document is the `Instance`.

***

Go to an activity Settings, then `Publish activity`. A dialog shows you the activity's status on the remote and a couple of brief information:

* Its name.
* Its status.
* Its types and timer.
* Eventually, the provider if it is already published.

About the status, it indicates at a glance the action to do to manage the activity lifecycle:

* `No changes`: It is up-to-date.
* `Local changes`: The activity has been managed on the document.
* `Remote changes`: A new version has been published, and the local version can be updated.
* `Unpublished`: It can be published remotely.
* `Not found`: The remote master may be unpublished.
* `Waitingâ€¦`: The communication with the remote Master is ongoing, but it can result in an error.
