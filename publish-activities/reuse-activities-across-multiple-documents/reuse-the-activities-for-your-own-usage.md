# Reuse the activities for your own usage

You can go to `Activity` then `Your activity`. This list gathers all the live activities you have published. From this list, you can:

* `Unpublish`: Remove the Master activity from the remote. This action is irreversible.
* `Share with the community` or `Remove from the community`: You allow other users to add your activity to their files.
* `Duplicate to local`: An activity instance is pushed to the document. It can be updated and republished later.
* `Search activitiesâ€¦`: Quickly go to an activity that is precisely known.
