# Set the idea types

You can rename the type and set as many types as you need for your activity. Then, you can:

* Change the name of the type.
* Select a color (for the sticky note):
  * `Gray`.
  * `Red`.
  * `Orange`.
  * `Yellow`.
  * `Green`.
  * `Blue`.
  * `Violet`.
  * `Pink`.
  * `Light gray`.
* Change the description.

You can also reorder the types by dragging and dropping rows as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
An activity must have at least one type.
