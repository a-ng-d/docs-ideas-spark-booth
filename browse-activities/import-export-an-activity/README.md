# Import/Export an activity

{% embed url="https://screen.studio/share/eAAmfyma" fullWidth="true" %}

An activity is composed of:

* Configuration data.
* `History sessions` data.
* Ideas related to the `History sessions`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The activities are encapsulated in the file and must be exported and then imported to another document. This is not ideal, but it allows you to use the activities you have facilitated on a `FigJam` board on a `Slides` document.
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="export-an-activity.md" %}

{% content-ref url="import-an-activity.md" %}
