# Explore activities

You can go to `Explore`, to retrieve a list of shared activities provided by `Ideas Spark Booth` Users. These activities keep a link to their `Master` and can be synchronized if the user publishes a new version. You must click `Synchronize activity` to check the status.

From the list, you can:

* `Duplicate to local`: An activity instance is pushed to the document. It can be updated but cannot be republished later.
* `Search activitiesâ€¦`: Quickly go to a specific activity or a group of activities.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the activities you duplicate are session- and idea-free. Indeed, only the activity settings can be published (global, timer, types).
{% endhint %}
