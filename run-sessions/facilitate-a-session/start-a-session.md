# Start a session

When starting a session from a defined activity, you and the persons who have already opened the `Ideas Spark Booth` are moved to a specific context to participate and type ideas. Everyone will be notified of who has started the new session.

When starting a new session, your role is automatically set to `Facilitator`.

To start a session, you can:

* Click the `Play` button of the related activity on the `Activity`, then the `Local` section.
* Open the related activity settings (by clicking the `Settings` button), then click `New Session`.

After starting a session, the timer of the `FigJam` board activates automatically based on the activity's timer configuration.
