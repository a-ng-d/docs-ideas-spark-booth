# Monitor the session activity

During the session, your role allows you to watch:

* The number of ideas sorted by idea type.
* The list of participants who have joined the session (by running the `Ideas Spark Booth`).
  * You are spotted with the tag `You`.
  * Participants who finished typing their ideas are flagged as `Finished`.
