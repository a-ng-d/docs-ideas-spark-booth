# End the session

When you think the session must end (time is up or participants have finished typing), click the `End session` button, then confirm the end.

Once ended, the ideas are sorted according to the `Group by` selection:

* On `FigJam`, the ideas are encapsulated in `Sections` named like the type they refer to or the participant's name. These sections are nested in a section named after this model `Activity nameãƒ»Session Start Date`.
* On `Slides`, the ideas are encapsulated in `Slides` named like the type they refer to or the participant's name. A session overview is generated before the ideas with:
  * The facilitator's name.
  * &#x20;The list of the participants.
  * The session duration.
  * The ideas distribution.
