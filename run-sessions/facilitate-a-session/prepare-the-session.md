# Prepare the session

As a facilitator, you must provide the best context for your participants. Whatever the editor you are, you can add an overview of the activity directly on the `FigJam` board and the `Slides` document:

* On `FigJam`, you can go to the activity Settings, then click the Ellipses button and click `Add template to board`. This way, the global information and the saved template will be added to the board from your current point of view.
* On `Slides`, you can go to the activity Settings, then click the Ellipses button and click `Add overview to slides`. This way, the global information split into slides will be added to the slides just after the last one.
