# Learn from the context

When a facilitator starts a session, you can move to the active session and a specific context for typing your ideas. You can learn more about what the session expects from you by reading on the right bar:

* The `Facilitator` of the session
* The `Description` of the activity.
* The different `Types` you have with their description.

Feel free to contact the facilitator if you lack information. You might use the `FigJam` board or `Slides` in-app microphone.
