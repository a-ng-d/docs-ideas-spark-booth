# Bulk type ideas

At the bottom, you have a section to type your ideas:

* Choose the type according to the defined ones.
* Type your idea without any character limit.
* You can add an idea by clicking the `Plus` button or pressing `Cmd ⌘ + ⏎` or `Ctrl ⌃ + ⏎`. However, this method does not work if the idea is empty.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once terminated, you can flag the facilitator you have finished.
{% endhint %}
